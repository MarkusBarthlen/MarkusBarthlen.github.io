      <description>Fasting I recently came across intermittend fasting. And the list of health benefits mentioned by various articles such as this is astonishing.
Intermittend fasting is supposed to improve blood sugar control, reduce chronic inflammation, reduce blood pressure, improve brain function, increase growth hormones (HGH), delay aging and help fight cancer.
While the health benefits of exercise are very well known, it came as a surprise to me that fasting is so beneficial.</description>
