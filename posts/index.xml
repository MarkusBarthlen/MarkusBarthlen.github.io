      <description>The importance of practicing control of your life You might have heard how important exercise is in order to stay healthy [1]. Or you might have heard that a regular sleep cycle [2] and regularity in your breakfast, lunch or dinner times can be beneficial. It has even been discovered that maintaining a &amp;ldquo;power pose&amp;rdquo; posture for 2-5 minutes can increase testosterone levels by 20% and decrease cortisol levels in your brain by 10-25% [3].</description>

      <description>Best books I read in 2020  Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson  Easy to read and full of good quotes. I especially loved the parts about happiness. You might not even recognize that happiness is a valid goal in life. And it can have enormous impact on other aspects of your life. It&amp;rsquo;s free https://www.navalmanack.com. The best book I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.
Oxygen by Nick Lane  A tremendous book that will change your perspective on cell biology and possibly make you think about how you can live your life to better protect your cells.</description>

      <description>Addictions My thought of the day is how sad it is that so many people on this planet are addicted to all kinds of things and have maybe never ever been free. Addicted to social media, games, food, work etc. The true tragedy of our days.</description>

      <description>Oxygen by Nick Lane I recently came across the book &amp;ldquo;Oxygen&amp;rdquo; by Nick Lane after watching the youtube channel SciManDan. This book provides both an overview of the discovery of the element, its historical importance, the changes of oxygen levels in the atmosphere and its influence on the metabolism of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Interestingly, historical oxygen levels are not known without doubt. There is also no evidence that oxygen ever caused a mass extinction of anaerob organisms.</description>

      <description>Fasting I recently came across intermittend fasting. And the list of health benefits mentioned by various articles such as this is astonishing.
Intermittend fasting is supposed to improve blood sugar control, reduce chronic inflammation, reduce blood pressure, improve brain function, increase growth hormones (HGH), delay aging and help fight cancer.
While the health benefits of exercise are very well known, it came as a surprise to me that fasting is so beneficial.</description>
